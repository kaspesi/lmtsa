  <h1>Overall Layout</h1>
<h1>How to Maintain Interest</h1>
<p>
In order to keep the reader engaged, you must consider the KISS method, (Keep It Simple, Stupid). The average person scans more commonly than they read. Creating a concise, easy-to-read website means limiting your content to what is necessary. Draw the reader's eye to the most important anecdotes and format your website in a manner that flows from beginning to end. Below are a few pointers that should highlight the essentials.</p>
	<ol>
        <li>Use strategic formatting</li>
		<li>Headlines and Subheads</li>
		<li>Bullets and Numbering</li>
		<li>Utilize deep captions</li>
		<li>Include important links</li>
    </ol>
  	<h1> Strategic Formatting </h1>
<p>Formatting is one of the keys to an inciting website. You want your reader to be able to scan through and locate to essential information with ease. <b> Make sure to bold important concepts</b>, and highlight only the message you want the reader to receive.</p>
 <p>Another helpful notion is the line break. Even the most complex material can be simplified by shortening paragraphs. Keep one idea within each paragraph and keep them concise â€“ no more that three to four sentences.</p>
 <p>Sometimes the most important paragraphs are one sentence.</p>
  </div> 
  <div id="subtext">
    
    <h1> Make Awesome Headlines and Subheads </h1>
	<p> A strong headline is a crucial component in grabbing the reader. Solid subheads keep the reader engaged by acting as mini-headlines to keep them moving through the page. You want your subheads to be engaging, however they should be informative as well. If you exaggerate too much, your website will lose credibility.
 </p>
 <h1> Bullets and Numbering </h1>
 	<ul>
    	<li>      Bullet points create an easily navigable path to present multiple points </li>
		<li> They are distinguishable from the rest of your text, providing a visual break for your reader</li>
		<li> Numbering summarizes your content into a list that allows your reader to understand the gist of the entire page in a few points</li>
		<li> As evidenced by the list at the top of this page, you can see that there are five general tips that envelop the details of this page</li>
	  </ul>
        <h1>Utilize Deep Captions</h1>
<p> Studies show that image captions are consistently one of the more commonly read items on a webpage. <b class="bold"> A deep caption is one that is about two to three sentences long and categorizes an image or display associated with it.</b>  A strong deep caption paired with an inviting image can draw your reader and keep them interested.
