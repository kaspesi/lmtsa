    <p>In this new age of technology and fast-paced advancements in just about everything, it is key to know how to connect to people and make your point known. Reading the newspaper or writing a letter is seen as old-fashioned now - for our generation, it's all about communicating through texting and social media. The most common way to share one's ideas is by using the internet; many people who want to stand out as individuals build their own websites. There are many ways to go about creating your own page, and it is actually relatively easy to do, once you have the skills and some ideas. After that, there are infinite possibilities for where your site can go- you are only restricted by your creativity.</p>
  
  <p>This website is going to help guide you through the basics of building your own website. We have included the foundations, such as how to code your pages and how to publish your website, as well as concepts of using color and fonts to captivate your readers. Don't think of this website as a strict rulebook or blueprints, but rather as some helpful reminders and tips for making your site as original and effective as possible.</p>
