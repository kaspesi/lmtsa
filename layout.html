  <h1>Overall Layout</h1>
    <p>Before you begin writing and designing your pages, you will want to figure out the overall look of your site. Decide where you want your pages to appear, whether that is on a sidebar or across the top of the website. If you want a banner to be along the sides, top, or bottom, then you will want to think about exactly where things line up and begin and end. Things on a website need to flow properly, and you should keep in mind what you like in a good website.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Something that is very useful for setting up your website is making a sitemap on paper. By using a sitemap, you can set things up so that you know where everything goes, make sure that nothing is getting repeated, and keep things organized in a neat space. Since your website and content are on the computer, it is useful to have at least one aspect of your website on paper so that nothing gets too confusing as you make your site. Your readers may not see this side of the website, but it will certainly make your life easier.</p>

    <h1>Page Design</h1>


<p>
When setting up your website, you first want to layout what your pages will look like first. Think about what you want your readers to see first, what you want them to remember most about your page. If you have too much on your page, then they will not remember it later- it might overload their brain.
</p><p>
Keeping that in mind, you can place your content. Do you want to center things, so that your reader's eyes will be drawn to videos or pictures? Or, do you want to move them over to the side or make them smaller if they are not as important as the body text? After you place things onto your pages, you are ready to format them so that they are visually appealing.</p>
